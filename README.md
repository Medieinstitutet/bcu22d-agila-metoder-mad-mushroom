<h1>Smart promise - because you don’t want to lose your pinky ;)</h1>
<p><b>Epic: </b>

<b>Introduction:</b>
This dapp will allow people to verify promises, and make sure they are kept - digitally!
Our research shows that 99.9% of all pinky-promises aren't kept.
We expect the use of this dapp to be simple to learn and easy for the broad public to understand.
This will skyrocket the amount of promises kept.
People will no longer have to rely on ‘gut feeling’ when going into agreements.
Ideally, this can be used to build a safer, decentralized and transparent economy. For everyone.
Meanwhile, the MVP is focused allowing two participants to make functioning Smart Promises with help of our smart contract, on the blockchain.

<b>Product Requirements:</b>
The user can visit the Smart Promise application and website.
The user can log in with Metamask.
The user can create a custom contract.
The user can deposit money into the smart contract.
The user can create a Smart Promise link with an unique ID to send to the other participant.
The contract has a timer for 10 minutes with an exp. date.
The (other) user can accept and sign the Smart Promise with Metamask.
The contract is able to send money back to its depositors.


<b>Design requirements:</b>
The site should be simple and easy to understand and orient around.
The site should have an appealing, clean design.


<b>User stories:</b>
As a user living in the modern day and digital age, I want to create trustless contracts with people I’m not sure I trust without having to worry about it. 

As someone who’s about to get married, I want my prenup set in stone on the blockchain, so there can’t be any backtracking when it finally comes to the divorce. 

As someone who loves working out and making bets, I want to really challenge and motivate my fellow gym bro to go to the gym with me every day for a week. If there’s money in the game, then it’s serious business. 

As the leader of a developer team, I don’t want to get screwed over by scammy employers when being hired for seasonal projects.
