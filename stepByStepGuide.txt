1. First, users will need to connect their wallet to the app. This can be done by clicking on the "Connect Wallet" button and selecting the appropriate wallet provider, such as Metamask.

2. Next, users can create a new Smart Promise by clicking on the "Create SmartPromise" button.
   They will need to enter a title for the promise and deposit a specified amount of Ethereum as collateral.

3. After creating a Smart Promise, users will be given a unique ID for the promise.
   They can then share this ID with other participants, who can use it to join the promise.

4. Participants can join the promise by clicking on the "Join SmartPromise" button and entering the unique ID, along with the specified collateral amount.

5. Once all participants have joined the promise, they can sign it to indicate that they have fulfilled their end of the agreement.

6. After all participants have signed the promise, the initial depositor can end the promise and withdraw the collateral.

its important to note that the 10-minute limit is crucial to ensure that both parties are committed to fulfilling the promise in a timely manner. The SmartPromise will expire after 10 minutes, and the funds will be returned to the initial depositor if the other party has not joined.
