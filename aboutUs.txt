At SmartPromise, we believe in revolutionizing the way promises are made in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.
 We understand that trustless systems require trustworthy tools, and that's exactly what we aim to provide. 
 Our team of experienced developers and blockchain enthusiasts have come together to create a platform that sets a new standard for promises in the DeFi space.

Our dApp, SmartPromise, allows users to create custom contracts, deposit money, and generate unique links to send to other participants. 
These contracts have a timer of 10 minutes, with an expiration date, after which the other participant can accept and sign the promise using their Metamask wallet. 
The contract also allows for the depositors to receive their money back, if necessary.

But beyond the technicalities of our dApp, our vision is to create a more secure and reliable way for individuals to make promises in the DeFi space. 
We understand the importance of trust in financial transactions and want to provide a platform that instills trust in its users. 
We believe that our dApp will pave the way for more efficient and secure promise-making in the DeFi space, 
ultimately leading to greater adoption and growth in the industry.

We are excited about the future of DeFi and are committed to building the tools and infrastructure necessary to make it a reality.
Join us on this journey and be a part of shaping the future of finance.
